# Getting Started with Plane/No-Plane Transformers Classifier

This guide will help you get started with the Plane/No-Plane Transformers Classifier. Follow the steps below to set up your environment and run the classifier.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pip

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine (if applicable).

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

Set Up Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can set up a virtual environment using venv or virtualenv.

bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using pip. A requirements.txt file can be generated from the notebook.

First, install pipreqs if you haven't already:

bash

pip install pipreqs

Then, convert the notebook to a Python script and generate requirements.txt:

bash

jupyter nbconvert --to script plane_no_plane_transformers_classifier.ipynb
pipreqs /path/to/your/directory

Install the dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Notebook
Start Jupyter Notebook

Start the Jupyter Notebook server.

bash

jupyter notebook

Open the Notebook

Open the plane_no_plane_transformers_classifier.ipynb notebook in your browser through the Jupyter interface.
Run the Notebook

Run the cells in the notebook to execute the Plane/No-Plane Transformers Classifier.

For any questions or issues, please open an issue on the repository or contact the maintainer.
Manually Creating requirements.txt

Since the environment might not have pipreqs installed, you can generate the requirements.txt file manually by listing the packages you used in the notebook. Here is a sample requirements.txt content:

plaintext

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
transformers
torch

Save this content as requirements.txt in your project directory. Adjust the package list as needed based on the actual imports in your notebook.
